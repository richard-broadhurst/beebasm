# beebasm
My version of beebasm that I use for my games.

Origanally written By RichTW and main version is https://github.com/stardot/beebasm

Main command line option changes:


-d and -dd

dump labels and scoped labels


-writes

sets the number of disc writes in the generated .SSD

useful if you are using the number of writes to a disc as some sort of catalogue number


Main directive changes:


PRINT CALLSTACK$

dumps the start of each scope leading to the current line,

useful for showing errors in macros


INCBASIC "file.bas"

includes the tokenised version of the file at the current address,

useful for appending assembler to the end of BASIC programs


PRINT "text_",~&CODE

prints text_CODE without any spaces where the commas are,

this is useful if you are concatenating variable for outputing to a later build stage
